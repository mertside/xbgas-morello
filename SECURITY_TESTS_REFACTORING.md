# Security Tests Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactored memory security evaluation tests for the xBGAS-Morello project.

## Overview

Following the pattern established with `ttu_s4_oob_read_refactored.c`, I have created high-quality refactored versions of key memory security tests. These refactored tests provide enhanced documentation, improved structure, and detailed CHERI capability analysis.

## Conclusion

The refactored security tests significantly improve the quality and usefulness of the xBGAS-Morello security evaluation suite. They provide comprehensive analysis of CHERI-Morello's memory safety capabilities while maintaining high code quality standards and detailed documentation.

These tests serve as both security evaluation tools and educational examples of how CHERI capabilities protect against common memory safety vulnerabilities.
