2. **`xbrtime_api.h`** - Clean public API interface with comprehensive documentation  
3. **`xbrtime_internal.h`** - Internal data structures and function prototypes

### Enhanced Existing Headers
4. **`xbMrtime-types.h`** - Improved type definitions with detailed documentation
5. **`xbMrtime-macros.h`** - Enhanced macro definitions with usage explanations
6. **`test.h`** - Refactored testing utilities with static inline functions

### Examples and Documentation
7. **`ttu_s4_oob_read_refactored.c`** - Exemplary security test with comprehensive documentation
8. **`Makefile_improved`** - Enhanced build system with category-specific targets
9. **`README_NEW.md`** - Comprehensive project documentation
10. **`REFACTORING_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed refactoring documentation

## üìã **Usage Instructions**

### For Existing Projects
```c
// Continue using existing headers - no changes required
#include "xbrtime_morello.h"
// Everything works exactly as before
```

### For New Projects (Recommended)
```c
// Use the new, improved interface
#include "xbrtime_api.h"
// Enjoy better documentation and cleaner interface
```

### Building with Enhanced Features
```bash
# Use the improved Makefile for better build options
cp Makefile_improved Makefile

# Build with category-specific targets
make spatial    # Build spatial safety tests only
make temporal   # Build temporal safety tests only
make analyze    # Analyze test suite composition
```
