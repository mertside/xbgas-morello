# CHERI-Morello TTU Memory Safety Test Results Analysis

## Overview

The TTU memory safety tests have been successfully executed on the CHERI-Morello platform. This document explains how to interpret the results correctly.

## Key Understanding: Success vs Failure in CHERI Testing

**CRITICAL**: In CHERI-Morello memory safety testing, the interpretation of results is **inverted** from typical program testing:

### ✅ SUCCESS Indicators
- `In-address space security exception`
- `Killed: 9`
- `Segmentation fault` (with CHERI context)
- `Abort trap: 6`
- Program termination with non-zero exit code

**These indicate that CHERI-Morello successfully caught a memory safety violation!**

### ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES
- Normal program completion (exit code 0)
- No error messages
- "Test completed successfully" messages

**These may indicate that the vulnerability was NOT caught by CHERI protections.**

## Test Categories and Expected Behavior

### Spatial Safety Tests (5 tests)
- `ttu_s1_free_not_at_start_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_s2_free_not_on_heap_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_s3_null_ptr_dereference_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_s4_oob_read_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_s5_oob_write_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI

### Temporal Safety Tests (7 tests)
- `ttu_t1_double_free_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_t2_hm_fake_chunk_malloc_refactored` - May or may not be caught
- `ttu_t3_hm_house_of_spirit_refactored` - May or may not be caught
- `ttu_t4_hm_p_and_c_chunk_refactored` - May or may not be caught
- `ttu_t5_use_after_free_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_t6_uaf_function_pointer_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_t7_uaf_memcpy_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI

### Real-World Attack Tests (5 tests)
- `ttu_r1_HeartBleed_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_r2_dop_refactored` - May or may not be caught
- `ttu_r3_uaf_to_code_reuse_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_r4_illegal_ptr_deref_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI
- `ttu_r5_df_switch_refactored` - Should be caught by CHERI

## How to Analyze Results

### 1. Use the Built-in Analysis Tools

```bash
# Run all tests and get comprehensive analysis
make run-all
make analyze

# Get quick summary
make summary

# Show only problematic results (tests that completed normally)
make show-failures

# Run the interpretation script
./interpret_results.sh
```

### 2. Manual Analysis

Check the log files in the `obj` directory (if running from TTU) or current directory (if running from obj):

```bash
# From TTU directory
ls obj/run_*.log

# From obj directory  
ls run_*.log
```

### 3. Example Good Results

```
Running ttu_s4_oob_read_refactored.exe...
In-address space security exception
  ✓ ttu_s4_oob_read_refactored.exe trapped by CHERI-Morello (exit code: 134)
```

### 4. Example Concerning Results

```
Running ttu_s1_free_not_at_start_refactored.exe...
Test completed without errors
  ⚠ ttu_s1_free_not_at_start_refactored.exe completed normally (vulnerability may not be caught)
```

## Understanding Your Test Results

Based on your output, the tests are performing **exactly as expected**:

1. **Many tests show "Killed" or "In-address space security exception"** - This is **excellent**! It means CHERI-Morello is successfully catching memory safety violations.

2. **Some tests complete normally** - This could indicate:
   - The test scenario doesn't trigger CHERI protections (by design)
   - The vulnerability is more subtle
   - The test needs refinement

3. **Overall Assessment**: If most tests are being "killed" by CHERI, your system is working correctly and providing strong memory safety guarantees.

## Expected Protection Rates

- **Spatial Safety**: 80-100% should be caught by CHERI
- **Temporal Safety**: 60-80% should be caught (some heap manipulation tests are harder to catch)
- **Real-World**: 70-90% should be caught

## Automation Commands

```bash
# Complete test run with analysis
make run-all && ./interpret_results.sh

# Just get the summary
make summary

# See detailed analysis  
make analyze

# Check which tests weren't caught
make show-failures
```

## Conclusion

Your CHERI-Morello system appears to be working correctly based on the "Killed" and exception outputs you're seeing. These are **successes**, not failures, in the context of memory safety testing.
